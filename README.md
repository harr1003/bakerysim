A baking simulation game!

An idea that has been cooking in my brain is a 2d bakery simulation game utilizing java, C++, or C#. The player would have the task of running a bakery successfully. Functionality of the game would be prioritized in the following order: Creating a way for the player to follow recipes and create dishes successfully, a pricing and selling system for the player to adjust, buying and growing bakery resources, unlocking recipes, character creation, and a fun little storyline.
